Subject: Follow-up on Order #12345 - Need update soon

Hi there,

I placed an order (#12345) on May 25th and selected expedited shipping. The order was supposed to arrive by May 30th, but I haven't received any shipping confirmation yet.

Could you please provide me with an update on my order status? I need these items by June 5th for an important event.

Please respond as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Michael Williams
