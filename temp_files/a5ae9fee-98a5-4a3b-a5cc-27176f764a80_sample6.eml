Subject: URGENT! Completely UNACCEPTABLE service

I am absolutely FURIOUS about the treatment I've received! 

This is the THIRD time I've had to contact you about my order #5566 
that was supposed to arrive TWO WEEKS AGO!

Your customer service has been terrible and I've wasted hours trying 
to resolve this simple issue.

Either ship my order IMMEDIATELY or refund my money IN FULL! 
If this isn't resolved within 24 HOURS I will be contacting my 
credit card company to dispute the charge and will be leaving 
reviews on every platform available.

Extremely dissatisfied,
Sam Roberts
