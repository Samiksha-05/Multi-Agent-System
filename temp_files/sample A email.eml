Subject: URGENT! Completely UNACCEPTABLE service!

I am absolutely FURIOUS about the treatment I've received! This is the THIRD time I've had to contact you about my order #5566 that was supposed to arrive TWO WEEKS AGO! Your customer service has been terrible and I demand an immediate refund and explanation. I will not wait any longer!!!

This is completely unacceptable for a company of your reputation. I expect a response within 24 hours or I will be filing a formal complaint and leaving negative reviews everywhere.

Very disappointed,
John Smith
