To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my extreme disappointment and frustration with my recent order #ORD-12345 placed on May 25, 2025.

This is the THIRD time I've had issues with your company! The products arrived damaged and incomplete. Several items were missing from the package, and those that were included were clearly damaged during shipping due to inadequate packaging.

I have already contacted your customer service line THREE TIMES and have been bounced around between representatives without any resolution. This is completely unacceptable!

I need this resolved IMMEDIATELY as I require these items for an important event this weekend. If I don't hear back within 24 hours, I will be forced to dispute the charge with my credit card company and post reviews of my experience on social media.

I expect a full refund or replacement shipped with expedited delivery by tomorrow. This is urgent!

Sincerely,
Jane Smith
