Subject: Request for pricing information on enterprise package

Hello,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire about your enterprise software package pricing. Our company is considering implementing your solution for our team of approximately 50 employees.

Could you please provide me with information on:
1. Pricing tiers for enterprise solutions
2. Available features in each tier
3. Implementation timeline and support options

Thank you for your assistance. I appreciate your time and look forward to your response.

Kind regards,
Sarah Johnson
