Hello Sales Team,

I'm reaching out to request a quote for your enterprise software solution that was recommended to us by one of your current customers.

Our company, Global Enterprises Inc., is looking to implement a new CRM system for our sales team of approximately 50 people across 5 regional offices. We're interested in the following features:
- Customer data management
- Sales pipeline tracking
- Integration with our existing ERP system
- Mobile access capabilities
- Comprehensive reporting

Could you please provide us with pricing information for your different tiers of service, as well as information about implementation timeframes and training options?

We would like to move forward with this project within the next quarter, so a response within the next week would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Michael Johnson
IT Director
Global Enterprises Inc.
